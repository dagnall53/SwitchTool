# SwitchTool
Rocnet MQTT switch setting tool for Rocrail 
## A simple tool for setting the switch positions on Servo operated points (turnouts)
Number of points (20) readable is limited by MQTT message limits

Reads data from the switches by ID and updates on and off positions.

Proof of principle code only!, not well written, but well commented...

## Hardware
designed for "wemos battery OLED board"
